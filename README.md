# Bike-Rental-Demand-Forecasting


I developed a data-driven demand forecasting system for a bike-sharing service to optimize bicycle allocation and reduce operational costs. This system predicts daily rental demands, enabling businesses to maintain optimal inventory levels and improve customer satisfaction.

Key Features:
Accurate Demand Forecasting: Built and deployed a Random Forest Regression model to predict bike rental demand with high accuracy.

Temporal Data Processing: Processed and analyzed temporal data spanning 700+ days, incorporating weather conditions, seasonality, and time-based patterns.

Feature Engineering: Engineered features such as weather conditions, seasonality, and temporal patterns to improve model performance.

Interactive Visualizations: Created interactive dashboards to track model performance and visualize demand trends.

High Accuracy: Achieved consistent prediction accuracy with an RMSE of 39 units, ensuring reliable forecasts.
